# ReactRandomComponents
Pie Chart, Date Picker and Slider

Here are the components I used in this demo:

Date Picker:

https://github.com/Hacker0x01/react-datepicker

Pie Chart: 

https://github.com/toomuchdesign/react-minimal-pie-chart

Slider:

https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-bootstrap-slider
(For this one, you'll also need to install jQuery - `npm i jquery`)

Also, make sure to update your `package.json` so that you're using React version 16.4.

All the code for these components is here:
